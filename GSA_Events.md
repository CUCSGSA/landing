### Friendsgiving
Our annual Friendsgiving event combines the spirit of Thanksgiving with a food donation drive. It's a time for gratitude and giving, as members of our community come together to share a meal and donate food items to those in need.

### Earth Day
This Earth Day, we focused on the intersection of technology and environmentalism. Students presented talks on leveraging AI and machine learning for climate studies, accompanied by a casual lunch of sandwiches. It was an enlightening experience for those interested in tech-driven environmental solutions.

### Research Fair
The Research Fair serves as a bridge between students and campus laboratories. Various labs presented their current projects, offering students insights into potential research opportunities and helping labs connect with aspiring researchers.
