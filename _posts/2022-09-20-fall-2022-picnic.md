### Come for ice pops and stay for merriment at the Fall Picnic

Join your fellow CS students for a fun afternoon picnic including:
- Cornhole
- Ladder ball
- Connect 4 (we're not sure either but it was part of our equipment rental from the rec center)
- Ice Pops!
- General merriment

The picnic will be from 4:30-6:30PM (feel free to join at any time/for any length of time as suits your schedule) at Sewall Field located near the Rec Center and Macky Auditorium.
