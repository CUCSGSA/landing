## Resources for School Enrollment

- [Enrolling in any of the public preschools/elementary schools in the boulder valley school district](https://www.bvsd.org/parents-students/enrollment/preschool) (to add context to this - you are guaranteed a spot in your neighborhood school based on your home address, but you can apply to a different school during the open enrollment period)

- [Researching the public schools in the area](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/colorado/boulder-county/pre)

## Resources for adding family to health insurance:

- *"Under the Student Health Insurance Plan, unfortunately there is not an option to add dependents or spouses. Our recommendation is to look on the Colorado Health Exchange for a plan that may work for this studentâ€™s child. They can view plans on the Health Exchange at Connect for Health Colorado [here](https://connectforhealthco.com/?msclkid=4bb635afbaa111ec8829f98ebad9cfeb)"*
