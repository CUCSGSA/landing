## Our Origin Story

The Computer Science Graduate Professional Development Club (CS-GPDC) at CU Boulder was established in Fall 2021. The then current graduate students identified a shared challenge in navigating the competitive job market while balancing the demands of academic life. They further identified the lack of mentorship opportunities for the technical job market. With internship and job application timelines beginning early, many students found themselves underprepared.
During that semester, the idea to form a dedicated professional development club targeted at computing technical needs emerged from student discussions. With strong support from the department’s advising team, the CS-GPDC was launched, organizing its leadership structure, formalizing operations, and securing funding to begin programming.

Since its inception, CS-GPDC has hosted a wide range of initiatives - including technical mock interviews from industry partners and alumni, resume review sessions from alumni and senior graduate students, coding competitions focused on current industry directions, industry speaker series, and mentorship events - aimed at empowering students with the skills, confidence, and connections needed to succeed in the current job environment.
Today, CS-GPDC continues to grow, driven by committed student leaders, a very supporting cast of coordinators and a strong support from the departmental. The club remains focused on helping CU Boulder’s CS graduate students thrive in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.

## We also have had our alumni and various industry experts give talks on a variety of topics.
