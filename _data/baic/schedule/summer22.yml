  summary: Implementing a DEI strategy in Computer Science is a priority. However, there are certain challenges that can complicate the process or keep it at a dead end. Familiarity with DEI challenges can provide clarity on why a strategy may be stalling and how to assign efforts in a different way to address those challenges.  What are the challenges and what is your expectation? These conversations aim to bring awareness and provide education around the essential topics of diversity, antiracism and inclusion as they relate to computer science and our department through candid exploration of various themes.
