This workshop 120 minutes builds on the consciousness and awareness developed in the first two workshops by adding skills and techniques for creating more inclusive cultures. We explain how to observe and identify oppressive behaviors, how to engage in one on one conversations to address oppressive behaviors, and we outline strategies for intervening in group settings when oppressive behaviors show up. At each stage, we emphasize restoring and repairing relationships to ensure we can stay together on our journey to inclusive culture.

      * Learn how to PAN (pay attention now) and practice this skill
      * Learn skills for crucial one on one conversations and practice this skill
      * Learn how to intervene when you witness oppressive behaviors or language in group settings and practice this skill
